SPLATNet(Sparse Lattice Network) has several advantages for point cloud processing:
1. SPLATNet takes the point cloud as input without any pre-processing
2. SPLATNet allows an easy specification of filter neightborhood as standard CNN
3. With hash table,	it can efficiently deal with sparsity in point cloud bt convoling only at locations where data present
4 It computes hierarchical and spatially-aware features of an input point cloud with sparse and efficient lattice filters
