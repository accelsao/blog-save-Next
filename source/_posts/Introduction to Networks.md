A - Metropolitan Area Network 比 LAN大 WAN小 規模大多是city, town, 大學
B - LAN 兩個是LAN Switches
C - WLAN 用wifi連接
D - Wide Area Network 連接物理距離很遠的電腦 可以用低電壓來通訊

zeroday attack 零時差攻擊 還沒有修補漏洞的程式 利用這個漏洞來攻擊

Routers,switch, access points are intermediarydevices


AAn intranet is a private connection of LANs and WANs that belongs to an organization, and is designed to be accessible only by the members and employees of the organization, or others with authorization.
Refer to curriculum topic: 1.2.3
Intranets connect LANs and WANs that should only be accessible by internal employees, whereas an extranet allows organizations to do business directly with other external organizations by allowing them access to part of the internal network.


A WAN provides access to other networks over a large geographic area. A SAN provides data storage, retrieval, and replication. A MAN spans a limited physical area such as a city. A LAN provides access in a small geographic area.



A converged network unifies different network services, such as streaming video, voice, and data, on a single platform and within a single infrastructure.


Routers and switches are intermediary devices. End devices consist of PCs, laptops, and servers. They also include printers, VoIP phones, security cameras, and hand-held devices. 


Metro Ethernet high-speed business class copper or fiber connection
satellite requires a dish and clear line of sight for service
SDSL business class service that provides the same upload and download speeds over telephone lines
cable signal carried on the same copper or fiber medium as the television signal
cellular access via the cell phone network
