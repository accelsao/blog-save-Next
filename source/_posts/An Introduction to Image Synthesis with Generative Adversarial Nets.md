[Image Synthesis with GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.04469.pdf)

# Intro
There are two main threads of research on GAN
one is theoretical thread, mode collapse and alleviate the instability, or reformulate it from different angles like information theory and energy-based models
The other thread focus on applications on CV,NLP
