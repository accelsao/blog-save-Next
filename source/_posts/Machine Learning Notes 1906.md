## [Challenging Common Assumptions in the Unsupervised Learning of Disentangled Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.12359)
1. The disantanglement scores of unsupervised models are heavily influenced by randomness(random seed) and the choice of the hyperparameter(regularization strength).
The objective function appears to have less impact.
