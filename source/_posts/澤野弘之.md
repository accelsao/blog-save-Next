# Perfect Time

## Lyric
[mpi]

Elizabeth
Your tears and my fears are almost disappear
So let's share the perfect time. For you and me
You knocked on my door
So let's start our journey
Because you came to see me first

And your loneliness and kindness are could be my trigger
So lets share the perfect time
Can you grab both my arms and we'll jump out the window
Let's see what our future holds

There's no time
You can't ignore how you feel inside
I can't wait to see them all from my heart
Take my hand


[mpi & Mika Kobayashi]

And your loneliness and kindness are could be my trigger
So lets share the perfect time
Can you grab both my arms and we'll jump out the window
Let's see what our future holds

There's no time
You can't ignore how you feel inside
I can't wait to see them all from my heart
Take my hand
So show your smile
I will stay with you so
Oh You are the one I've got to hide
