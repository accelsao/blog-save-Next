# INTRODUCTION
Action recognition after-the-fact video understanding
Action prediction before-the-fact video understanding
The major difference between these two lies in *when to make a decision*

## Real-World Applications
* Visual Surveillance
* Video Retrieval
* Entertainment
* Human-Robat Interaction
* Autonomous Driving Vehicle

## Research Challenges
* Intra- and inter-class Variations
* Cluttered Background and Camera Motion
*  Insufficient Annotated Data
* Uneven Predictability

# HUMAN PERCEPTION OF ACTIONS


### Action Classifiers
* Direct classification
* Part-based approaches
* Manifold Learning Approaches
	temporally variational human silhouettes
* Mid-level approaches
* Feature fusion approaches
